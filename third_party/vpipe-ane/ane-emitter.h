// Writes a compiled CoreML model (.mlmodelc) directly, with no
// coremltools and no Python.
//
// WHY. A compiled module's SHAPE is baked into its graph, so anything
// that ships prebuilt modules is keyed on the shapes it was built for
// -- a new resolution, a new width, a new model means a new artefact.
// Emitting the graph here removes that: any shape, at load, from the
// caller's own weights.
//
// THIS IS FEASIBLE ONLY BECAUSE THE THREE FILES ARE SIMPLE, and each
// was established by inspecting what coremltools produces:
//
//   model.mil           ASCII TEXT. Not a protobuf -- the graph is
//                       emitted as source, which is why this class is
//                       a few hundred lines rather than a schema.
//   coremldata.bin      a fixed 83-byte header, a small protobuf
//                       describing one input and one output, and a
//                       16-byte footer.
//   weights/weight.bin  a 64-byte file header, then per weight a
//                       64-byte entry header (magic 0xdeadbeef, byte
//                       size at +8, data offset at +16) and the data
//                       verbatim, row-major, no permutation. EVERY
//                       ENTRY HEADER STARTS ON A 64-BYTE BOUNDARY: after
//                       a slab whose size is not a multiple of 64 the
//                       next header is padded forward (coremltools
//                       writes 2146 bytes of data, then 30 of padding),
//                       so data offsets are always 64-aligned. The file
//                       is not padded after its last slab.
//
// `analytics/` is NOT required -- a module without it loads and
// predicts.
//
// A `BLOBFILE` offset in the .mil names the weight's ENTRY HEADER, not
// its data: entry 0 is referenced at 64 and its bytes start at 128.
// Getting that wrong reads the header as weights.
//
// NONE OF THIS IS DOCUMENTED BY APPLE. It is inferred from emitted
// artefacts and could change with any macOS release, which is why
// self_test() exists and why every failure path here must leave the
// caller free to use its GPU implementation instead. Emitting a model
// that does not load is recoverable; emitting one that loads and
// computes the wrong thing is not, so the self-test checks NUMBERS,
// not just that a load succeeded.
